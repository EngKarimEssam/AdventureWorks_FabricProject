Steps:
- Create Lakehouse, then load Excel file data
- Load Data into Lakehouse using Dataflow Gen2
  - Duplicate the file (Fact and Dims)
  - Check the data type and other transformations 
- Querying SQL using SQL analytics endpoint

  - Same result can also be done using Visual Query, an easy and fast tool for complex queries to get it done faster than writing the code.
 
    
- Again, load the Excel (DimDate) file, but now magic comes, drag and drop the file into the table folder.
  - what we did inside a dataflow, the same process is happening in the background, taking that file and converting it to a parquet file and then creating the delta table (no complexðŸ˜€)

-  
- Get data from Dataflow Gen2 as a data source

- power bi
- Direct Lake
- pipeline
